# Title: My First Student Grading System in C - A Learning Experience

Description:
Welcome to my first student grading system project written in the C programming language! This project is an opportunity for me to delve into the fundamentals of programming while exploring the concept of grading students based on their performance.

Although this project represents my initial journey into coding, I must admit that it contains a significant number of global variables, which may not be considered best practice. Additionally, the program relies heavily on the use of global variables rather than passing parameters between functions. However, I embrace this project as a learning experience and a stepping stone towards better programming practices.

In this student grading system, I have implemented various features to facilitate the grading process. It allows me to enter student details such as name, ID, and scores for different subjects. Based on these inputs, the program calculates the average score, determines the grade, and displays the results.

As I continue to enhance my programming skills, I am actively exploring ways to refactor the code to reduce global variables and embrace the concept of parameter passing. By doing so, I aim to improve the program's modularity, reusability, and overall design.

I encourage you to explore this project, provide feedback, and share suggestions for improvement. Together, we can embark on a journey of growth and refinement as I strive to create more efficient and well-structured coding projects.

Thank you for joining me on this learning adventure!

Note: This project was created as part of my learning process and may not adhere to best programming practices. It serves as a starting point for improvement and serves as a testament to my growth as a programmer.
